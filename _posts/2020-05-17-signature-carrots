## Prep Directions (5 min)

1. Chop carrots: cut at a 45 degree angle between the vertical axess of the carrot and the knife; chop into thin slices of 1~2mm thickness (ideally)
2. Chop scallions: cut at 45 degree into 3~4 cm length pieces (similar length with the carrot slice)
3. Chop garlic: crush with knife; peel; cut at 45 degree into thin and long (as long as possible) slices

## Cook Directions (5 min)

1. Heat up 1 tbsp of preferred oil on high heat for 1 min; put the carrots in and let the bottom layer of carrots cook a bit for 30 sec
2. Stir & Fry: Stir the top carrots to the bottom and toss in garlic; let cook for another minute; you should see the oil color turning bright orange
3. Finish: toss in scallion; stir around for another 2 minutes or until carrots seem a bit soft and cooked; turn fire to low; drizzle in soy sauce and stir around (taste and add extra salt if necessary); the soy suace provides a thin layer of glaze and caramalized color on the carrots. 
4. Turn off fire and serve immediately! 

## Tips \& Explanations

* Getting carrots thin is key; it gets easier with practice and time!
* Do not disturb the carrots when you just put them into the hot oil is key; if you start stirring right away then the carrots may become too moist right away and you may never get the nice crispy (or even a bit charred) carrot slices
* Garlic towards the end to preserve all of its flavor and brings out the best of carrots; also, it won't burn as easily.
* Soy sauce also need to be add in the end when fire is turned low otherwise it's easy to burn up quickly and burned soy sauce taste doesn't go well.

## Story

My favorite veggie dish that my mom cooked me so so often when I grew up. It's so quick and easy to make!
Serving it with white rice is amazing because the carrots and its oil turn the rice bright orange. It is my favorate color!
