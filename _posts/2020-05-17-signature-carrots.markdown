## Prep Directions (5 min)

1. Chop the carrots
: Cut the carrot into thin (roughly 2mm thick) diagonal slices. The knife should be offset about 45 degrees from the axis of the carrot.
2. Chop the scallions
: Cut the scallions on the diagonal into 3~4 cm length pieces. The slices should be about as long as the carrot slices.
3. Chop the garlic
: Bruise the garlic with your knife and peel. Then cut the garlic crosswise into thin slices.

## Cooking Directions (5 min)

1. Get up to temp
: Heat up 1 tbsp of cooking oil on high heat until it shimmers.
2. Add the carrots
: After adding, let the bottom layer of carrots cook a bit for 30 sec
3. Stir & fry
: Stir the top carrots to the bottom and toss in the garlic. Let the carrots cook for another minute; you should see the oil color turning bright orange
4. Add the scallions
: Toss in the scallions and stir for another 2 minutes, or until carrots look a bit soft and cooked.
5. Finish!
: Turn the heat to low, drizzle in the soy sauce and stir. At this point, taste and add extra salt if necessary before serving. The soy suace creates a thin layer of glaze on the carrots, giving them a nice caramel color.


## Tips & Explanations

* Getting the carrots thin is key; it gets easier with practice and time!
* Do not disturb the carrots when you first put them into the hot oil is key. If you start stirring right away, the carrots will often become too moist and you may never get the right texture and color.
* Adding the garlic midway preserves its flavor and brings out the best of carrots. It also makes the garlic less likely to burn!
* Soy sauce should be added at the end when the fire is turned down low. Otherwise, it's easy for the soy sauce to burn.



## Story

<!-- excerpt-start -->
This is my favorite veggie dish that my mom would cook for me when I grew up. It's so quick and easy to make! Serving it with white rice is amazing because the carrots and their oil turn the rice bright orange - my favorate color!
